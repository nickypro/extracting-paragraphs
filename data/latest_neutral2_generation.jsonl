But how do solar panels actually work?\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight Absorption:** Solar panels are made up of many individual cells called photovoltaic (PV) cells. These cells are made from materials like silicon, which can absorb sunlight.\n\n2. **Electron Excitation:** When sunlight hits a PV cell, it knocks electrons loose from the silicon atoms. These excited electrons are now free to move around.\n\n3. **Electric Field:** The PV cell is designed with an electric field that separates the excited electrons from the \"holes\" (missing electrons) they leave behind.\n\n4. **Direct Current (DC) Generation:** This separation of charges creates a flow of electrons, which is direct current (DC) electricity.\n\n5. **Inverter Conversion:** The DC electricity generated by the solar panels needs to be converted to alternating current (AC) electricity, which is what is used in homes"}

Factor in potential increases in energy demand.\n\n**2. Your Roof:**\n\n* **Size and orientation:**  A south-facing roof with minimal shading is ideal for maximizing solar energy production. \n* **Angle:** The optimal angle for your solar panels depends on your location and the time of year.\n* **Roof type:** Most solar panels can be installed on various roof types, but some may require specialized mounting systems.\n* **Structural integrity:** Ensure your roof can support the weight of the solar panels and mounting equipment.\n\n"}
